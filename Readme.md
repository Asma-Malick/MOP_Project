## Important Note
Unfortunately, due to a virus attack on my laptop, all project files, including CSS files, images, and other relevant data, were lost. The only remaining file is the files from the project documentation, which I had stored on my phone. 

To maintain the brevity of the documentation, not all CSS files and images were included. Only a few critical CSS files were documented. 

## Repository Content
This repository contains the files from the project documentation only. Although the original files are lost, the remaining files can still provide valuable insights into the structure and functionality of the project.
